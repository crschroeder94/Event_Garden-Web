# Event_Garden-Web

I'm currently using XAMPP to run a local server on my computer and an sql database
You need to take these files and put them in the htdocs folder inside the XAMPP folder on your computer to be able to use it.
Once you have that up and running and have created the event_garden database, run the setup.php which will create the table
Note: you might have to change some of the credentials when accessing the database compared to my own so you'll have to figure that out
Once everything is set up, run map_php.php for the home page.
