# Event_Garden-Web

-using XAMPP to run a local apache server on my computer and a local sql database
Note: you may need to modify your local sql password to match the current setup and querying of the db which uses "root" with password 0000
-take github repo files and put them in an EventGarden folder in the htdocs folder inside the XAMPP folder on your computer
Once the event_garden database is created, run the setup.php which will create the tables

Once the database is established, go to 127.0.0.1/EventGarden/login.html to launch the website
